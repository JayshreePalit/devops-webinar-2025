# ðŸ“¦ Day 4 â€“ Docker Basics

## ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Understand Docker fundamentals and perform hands-on tasks like installing Docker, running containers, and managing images.

---

## ðŸ§  What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers. It helps avoid the "it works on my machine" problem by standardizing environments.

---

## âœ… Key Docker Concepts:

| Term        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Image**   | Blueprint for a container (like an OS + app pre-installed). |
| **Container** | Running instance of an image. Lightweight and fast. |
| **Dockerfile** | Script to build Docker images automatically. |
| **Docker Hub** | Public registry to share/pull images. |

---

## ðŸ”§ What I Did:

1. Installed Docker on Ubuntu using `apt`.
2. Verified installation with `docker --version`.
3. Ran the `hello-world` container.
4. Pulled and ran an NGINX container (`docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx`).
5. Used commands like `docker ps`, `docker images`, and `docker stop`.
6. Removed unused containers/images with `docker system prune`.

## ðŸ§  Learnings:

- Docker is extremely fast and lightweight for testing apps.
- `docker run` is powerful and can be used with many flags (`-d`, `-p`, `--name`).
- Cleaning up resources is important to save space.
- The containerized NGINX was accessible via browser â†’ `localhost:8080`.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Commands Used:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
docker --version
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo docker run hello-world
sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
sudo docker ps
sudo docker images
sudo docker system prune
