# ðŸ“¦ Day 6: Kubernetes Basics

## ðŸ§  What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration platform** that automates:

- **Deployment**
- **Scaling**
- **Load balancing**
- **Management of containerized applications**

It helps manage large numbers of containers in production environments.

## ðŸ”§ Why is Kubernetes Needed?

| Problem with Docker Alone | Solution with Kubernetes |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Difficult to scale        | Auto-scaling and load balancing |
| Manual deployment         | Automated deployments |
| No self-healing           | Kubernetes restarts failed containers |
| No service discovery      | Built-in DNS and service registry |

## ðŸš€ Key Concepts in Kubernetes:

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Pod** | Smallest deployable unit, holds one or more containers |
| **Node** | A single machine (VM or physical) in a Kubernetes cluster |
| **Cluster** | Group of nodes managed by Kubernetes |
| **Deployment** | Controller that manages Pods |
| **Service** | Exposes your Pod to the network |
| **Kubelet** | Agent on each node |
| **kubectl** | Command-line tool to interact with the cluster |

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to install and start Minikube (local Kubernetes cluster)
- Basic `kubectl` commands
- Creating a deployment and exposing it
- How Kubernetes manages containers more efficiently than Docker alone


---

## ðŸ§° Commands Used

```bash
minikube start
kubectl version
kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
