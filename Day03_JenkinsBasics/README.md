##  What I Learned
- Completed Jenkins setup: installed recommended plugins, configured URL, and created the admin user  
- Used `curl` to download the JNLP agent on the slave node  
- Registered the agent successfully and saw it listed in Jenkins as a connected node

##  Next Steps
- Build and run a simple job on this slave node  
- Explore Pipeline jobs using Jenkinsfiles  
- Automate agent setup using scripts or Ansible
